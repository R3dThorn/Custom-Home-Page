STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

## Concept
This custom web page is a personal project aimed at showcasing my skills as a front-end developer, but also to provide a home page that caters to my needs as a user.

## Checklist
Items will be added and checked off as the project progresses
1. [ ] Weather Page
    - [ ] Fullscreen upon clicking a card
    - [ ] Ability to store user information of weather cards
        - [ ] Write API that manages database of users
            - Python
            - MongoDB
            - Firebase Node.js package
    - [ ] Search bar to search for new cards & add them to user profile data table
    - [ ] Integrate other OpenWeatherAPI endpoints to provide even more weather information
    - [ ] A method of removing cards & removing them from user profile data table
2. [ ] Home Page
    - [ ] Google Custom Search bar integration
    - [ ] News APIs from around the globe
        - Perhaps add this info to user profile to allow dynamic news flow by providing other APIs
    - [ ] Traffic data that homes on geolocation (or default if set in profile)
3. [ ] (Ambitous) Write new derivative of Debian-based operating system and show it off on separate tab
4. [ ] Research cybersecurity measures to be able to protect user data
5. [ ] Secure URL for homepage hosting/deploy to Heroku

## Progress
Current progress has the skeletons of the weather and home pages available, with major work needing to be done about user authorization (basic Redux files have been imported, but they need modification to suit the application), the structure of the user profile (more than likely to be a giant JSON archive unless research points to a better solution), and visual effects.
